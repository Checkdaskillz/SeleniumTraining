 * Summary: Business objects is a java classes where methods / functions are stored.
 *          These objects will then be later called by the main test object to be executed.
 *          Business objects will be calling upon the page objects for retrieving the data.
 *
 * Note:    Make sure each method/function created does exactly what it is named. When your
 *          method/function begins to go on a tangent, it is best to create a new method/function
 *          for that operation.
