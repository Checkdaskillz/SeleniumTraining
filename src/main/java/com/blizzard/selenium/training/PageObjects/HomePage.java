/**
 * Created by DWebster on 5/29/2014.
 * Summary: Using this type of java class is very useful to breakdown clutter in code.
 *          Within this java class, only objects are held here. In Selenium's case, it will
 *          hold temporary values for elements which will be used by another class. This makes
 *          it possible for the objects to be reused multiple times from other classes.
 *          Less rewriting the code, the better.
